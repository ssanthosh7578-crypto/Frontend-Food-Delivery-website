           <p style="color: black;text-align: center;justify-content: center;font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;"> The Journey of Foodeiii started when the brothers, Damodaraswamy Naidu, Rangaswamy Naidu, Ramaswamy Naidu and Lakshman Naidu decided to start a petty shop opposite to the Kennedy Theatre to support the family. With sheer determination on delivering quality products at reasonable price, the business started attracting more loyal customers. In the 2005’s the owner of the Kennedy Theatre on seeing their determination and quality of business invited them to run the canteen at the theatre. ‘ The Famous Keera Vadai and Filter coffee’ was born. Back in the days quality snacks was rare, serving piping hot Filter coffee and crispy keera vada cooked from fresh oil set a new roll to the business.
            
            In 2years the Brothers were offered another canteen at the Central Theatre. The brothers were already planning on expanding as their customers were overflowing, selling snacks during the interval was restricting the customers. They decided to open their first bakery, Royal Coffee Bar at RS Puram. Following the Bakery, the brothers found a rental space on DB Road and decided to set up their first restaurant.</p>

        <h4 style="color: black;text-align: center;justify-content: center;font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">Foodies often have a deep appreciation for the cultural and historical aspects of food. They love to delve into the origins of dishes, understand the traditional cooking methods, and learn about the cultural significance of certain foods. For foodies, dining is not just about satisfying hunger; it's an immersive experience that engages all the senses. The presentation, aroma, texture, and taste of a dish all play crucial roles in their enjoyment.

            Many foodies are also advocates for sustainable and ethical food practices. They prioritize supporting local farmers, choosing organic produce, and seeking out restaurants that practice sustainability. They understand the impact of food choices on the environment and society, and they strive to make informed decisions that reflect their values.
            
            Being a foodie is also about community and connection. Food brings people together, and foodies love to share their experiences and discoveries with others. Whether it's through hosting dinner parties, participating in food tours, or simply enjoying a meal with friends and family, foodies cherish the social aspect of dining.
            
            In summary, a foodie is someone who sees food as more than just sustenance—they see it as a source of joy, discovery, and connection. They are passionate, curious, and always eager to explore the diverse world of culinary delights. 🍽️</h4>
